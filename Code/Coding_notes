    Note:
    1. Precision: P = TP/TP + FP - all correct classified / all classified

    2. Recall: R = TP/TP + FN - all correct classified / should be classified

    3. F1 weight the Precision and Recall, in other word choose which one is more important
        Default is P = R 

    4. Support is the number of occurrences of each class in test_outputs


    #1. training size and testing accurcy
    #2. select which feature is more important?
    #3. and which subset is more important to determine the phishing site
    #4. try different classifier for the dataset
    #5. statical test and T-test for selecting useful features


    # forward feature addition
    # backward feature elimination
