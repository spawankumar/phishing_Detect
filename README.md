# Detect Phishing website using differernt machine learning techniques
This repo is for Spring 2018 OSS project. Detecting phishing website via different machine learning techniques. Most of our code was from or inspired by npapernot's "Detecting phishing websites using a decision tree" you can find more [here](https://github.com/npapernot/phishing-detection).

## Installation

## Phishing Website Dataset

The dataset was collected by analyzing a collection of `11055` websites 
among which some were used for phishing and others not. For each website 
included in the dataset, `30` attributes are given.
The list includes for instance the URL length, whether the website
uses pop-up windows or Iframes, or how old the domain registration is.

Each website in the dataset is labeled by `-1` if it is not a phishing
website and by `1` if it is a website used for phishing.

## What next?

1. Choose a specific method and improve its performance on predit the phishing site.

2. What approach to take to improve the performance? (Hybrid algorithm, additional dataset, etc)
