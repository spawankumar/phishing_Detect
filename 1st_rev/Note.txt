Review #1
The paper analyzes web-based phishing detection by using Random Forest. The paper verifies the detection performance with feature selection is improved. The topic of this paper is interesting. However, the presentation of the paper can be improved if the following concerns can be addressed.

(1)     Please use the paper template suggested by MLICOM 2018. In the Figs. 2- 4, 
	the maps and headings should be centered. 
	In addition, Fig. 4 is not clear, please enlarge the fonts appropriately.
(2)     The format of the paper is not very standard, please use Formula Editor to edit the formula and the corresponding serial number of the formula should be aligned.
(3)     Please double-check the whole presentation of this paper.


Review #2
The topic of this paper is interesting and important. Some issues are as follows. 

The format of the equations in this paper should be carefully revised. 
All the equations (i.e., eq. (1) to eq. (6)) in this paper seem to be in the format of the figures, 
which are very unprofessional for a technical paper submission. 

In the experimental tests, what is the experimental-setting used? 
The discussions on the results are poor and need to be significantly improved.


Review #3
This paper focused on improving the accuracy, precision, and recall rate of the classifier by using 30 features, enhancing the detection of phishing, and recognizing more phishing sites. The topic of this paper is very interesting. The reviewer has some minor concerns as follows.

Concern 1: Please use the MLICOM paper template to organize the paper.
Concern 2: Please enlarge the font size in Fig. 4.


Review #4
The formulas should be clearer. 






1. Change the formula
2. Change the Fig.4
3. Experimental test: describe the experimental-setting.
4. Please use the MLICOM paper template to organize the paper.
5. Double check the whole presentation of the paper
